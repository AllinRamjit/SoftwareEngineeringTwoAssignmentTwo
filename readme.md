# Student Incentive System (Flask REST API ‚Äì MVC Refactor)

A Flask-based REST API implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to manage and incentivize student community service participation.  
This system refactors the original command-line application into a web-based service layer using RESTful endpoints, JWT authentication, and SQLAlchemy ORM for persistence.

---

## üß© Project Overview

The **Student Incentive System** enables staff to log community service hours for students, students to request confirmation of logged hours, and tracks milestones that award accolades for reaching service hour thresholds.  

This refactor transitions the CLI version into a structured **MVC Flask REST API**, maintaining existing business logic while adding REST views, modular controllers, and token-based authentication.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Apply the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern to organize the application.  
- Expose the system‚Äôs functionality through **RESTful API endpoints** (no user interface).  
- Implement **JWT token-based authentication** for secure access control.  
- Create **unit and integration tests** using `pytest` and `unittest`.  
- Document test plans and workflows for grading and user acceptance.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

### **1. Models (Data Layer)**
Implements database entities using **SQLAlchemy ORM**:

- `User` ‚Äì Base user model with authentication and JSON serialization methods.  
- `Student` ‚Äì Inherits from `User`, tracks community service hours and accolades.  
- `Staff` ‚Äì Inherits from `User`, can log, confirm, and reject hours.  
- `ActivityLog` ‚Äì Records community service activities with confirmation statuses.  
- `Accolade` ‚Äì Represents milestones based on total confirmed hours.  
- `LeaderBoardEntry` ‚Äì Tracks ranked student performance.

### **2. Controllers (Business Logic Layer)**
Encapsulates all reusable logic previously contained in CLI commands.  
Responsible for CRUD operations, validation, and workflow management.  

Examples:
- `staff_log_hours(staff_username, student_username, hours, activity)`
- `request_confirmation(student_username, activity_log_id)`
- `view_leaderboard()`
- `view_accolades(student_username)`
- `staff_confirm_hours(staff_username, activity_log_id)`
- `staff_reject_hours(staff_username, activity_log_id)`
- `update_leaderboard()`

### **3. Views (REST API Layer)**
Implements **Flask routes** to expose controller functions as REST endpoints.  
All endpoints follow `/api/...` format and require JWT authentication where applicable.

---

## üîê Authentication

Implemented using **Flask-JWT-Extended**.

### Workflow:
1. User logs in using `/api/login` with valid credentials.  
2. The server responds with an **access token (JWT)**.  
3. The token must be included in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent requests.  

**Header Example:**
```

Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

````

    staff = create_user("admin", "adminpass", user_type="staff")
    log = Staff.logHoursForStudent(student.studentID, 5, "Volunteering")
    log.status = "pending"
    db.session.commit()
    Staff.confirmHours(self, log.logID)
    updated_log = ActivityLog.query.filter_by(logID=log.logID).first()
    self.assertEqual(updated_log.status, "confirmed")
```

---

## üß© Postman API Testing

A **Postman collection** is provided:
`Student Incentive System API Tests.postman_collection.json`

To use:

1. Import into Postman.
2. Obtain a token via `/api/login`.
3. Add this header to requests:

   ```
   Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
   ```

Requests are grouped under **Student** and **Staff** folders for clarity.
